::TODO::
-add modify support
  -need to stash current value of todo so you can undo it
-switch to `fan` when listening for events inside of dyntodo
DONE-fix sorta leaks (see notes)
  -turns out there was no leaks, GHC RTS just hangs onto to memory for a while

::NOTES::

after a
>stack build --profile
running:
>stack exec --profile -- memorytests +RTS -hd
does not leak, but running
>stack exec --profile -- memorytests
does leak :joy:
